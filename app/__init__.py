"""
App package root for the MVC refactor.

This package organizes the codebase into clear MVC layers:
- Models: persistent data and domain entities
- Views: user interfaces (Console/TUI)
- Controllers: application flow and coordination between models and views
- Services: pure business logic/utilities (e.g., question generation, timing)

See individual modules for detailed write-ups.
